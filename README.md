# Trolley Simulation Project

## Description
This project is a Java program that models a real-world object, a Trolley, and its associated Engine. The program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, and encapsulation. It includes a main object class (`Trolley`), a secondary object class (`Engine`), and a tester class (`TrolleyTester`) to test the functionality.

## Features
- **Main Object Class (`Trolley`)**:
  - Includes 6 instance variables, one of which is an object of the `Engine` class.
  - Overloaded constructors for creating objects in different ways.
  - Accessor and mutator methods for all instance variables.
  - 4 behavior methods (2 with parameters, 2 without parameters).
  - A `toString()` method to describe the object.

- **Secondary Object Class (`Engine`)**:
  - Includes 1 instance variable (`type`).
  - Accessor and mutator methods for the instance variable.

- **Tester Class (`TrolleyTester`)**:
  - Creates objects using both constructors.
  - Calls behavior methods with and without parameters.
  - Prints object details using the `toString()` method.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: Contains the source code files (`Trolley.java`, `Engine.java`, `TrolleyTester.java`).
- `lib`: Contains any external dependencies (if applicable).
- `bin`: Contains the compiled output files.
